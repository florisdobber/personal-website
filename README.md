# Personal website

My personal website, created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted using GitHub pages and CloudFlare.

## Set up

- Instructions on how to set up Jekyll on macOS: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos.
- `git clone https://github.com/florisdobber/personal-website.git`

Now run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` to start a development server. For additional options, see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#build-command-options. 

## Other elements
Besides the code, there are other elements on this website which might be hard to recreate. For my own, and anyone who is interested, I've left a short description on how I created these.

### Profile image
The profile image was created using [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus), based on an a portrait photo and applying the `MK One Line Art` style. It was inspired by [Victoria Arzumanova's](https://www.victoriaarzu.com) work.

### Favicon
The favicon is `fd.` in the [IBM Plex Serif font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif). I then used https://realfavicongenerator.net to convert it to a favicon.

### Color scheme
The color scheme used on this website is [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com). It is heavily inspired by [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/), but slightly less warm.
