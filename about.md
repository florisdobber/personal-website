Hi, I'm Floris.
Currently I'm pursuing a master's in computational finance at UCL, building on my bachelor's in data science from Northeastern University.
In the past I've worked in data and software roles, across a variety of industries such as finance, grid enhancing technology and mobility.
In my free time I like to work on my own projects, some of which I've listed below.
