Hi, I'm Floris.
Currently I work as a software engineer at Meta, building on my master's in computational finance from UCL and bachelor's in data science from Northeastern University.
In the past I've worked in data and software roles, across a variety of industries such as finance, grid enhancing technology and mobility.
In my free time I like to work on my own projects, some of which I've listed below.
