I served as the president of [Code4Community]({{ page.link }}), an organization of roughly 50 students dedicated to providing software solutions to non-profits around Boston at no cost. C4C develops full-stack web apps to help our partners achieve their mission through the use of our software. During my time as president, we developed several products:

- [A platform](/projects/speak-for-the-trees) showing all trees in Boston to help [Speak for the Trees](https://treeboston.org) manage Boston's urban forest
- An event scheduling platform used by [Lucy's Love Bus](https://lucyslovebus.org) to plan and host events for kids with life threatening illnesses
- A library and book tracking system to help [Hands Across the Sea](https://handsacrossthesea.org) improve literacy rates in the Eastern Caribbean 
- A recommendation letter system used by [JPAL](https://www.povertyactionlab.org) to provide letters of recommendation to at-risk youth in NYC and beyond

The combined user base of these products was over 100,000 people, and the amout of people impacted by them was multiple times that. The organization has thrived since I graduated, maintaining the products mentioned above, as well as creating [additional products](https://www.c4cneu.com/projects) to help more organizations across Boston and beyond.
