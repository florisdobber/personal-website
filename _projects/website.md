This website, which has gone through several iterations throughout the years, is a place to find me on the internet. Depending on the iteration, it lists my contact details, a short about me section and a list of my projects and experiences. 

If you're interested in using this website as a template for your own website, you can find the code [here]({{ page.repo }}).
