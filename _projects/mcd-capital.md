I worked as a quantitative developer at [MCD Capital]({{ page.link }}), where I focused on designing and developing their automated trading system. The trading system traded a wide range of stocks, focusing on short-term trades using proprietary strategies. Developed in Python and interacting with exchanges through Interactive Brokers, the system employed an event-driven architecture that processed market data in real-time to place and manage orders, as well as manage inventory. Details on other attributes are confidential.
