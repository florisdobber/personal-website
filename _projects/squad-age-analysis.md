title: Squad Age Analysis
description: An analysis of squad age profiles in the Dutch Eredivisie.
start: 2019

Using R I scraped player data for all players in the Eredivisie (Dutch league) from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com). Following this, I cleaned the data and then used Tableau to illustrate the squad age profile of each team in the Eredivisie. The project was inspired by visuals I had seen from [Opta](https://www.statsperform.com/opta/) and soccer stats bloggers.
