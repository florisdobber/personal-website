As part of the MCFC x Hays hackathon, I created [OptiSub]({{ page.link }}), a Flask app to help coaches optimize their substitutions during games. The app was chosen as one of the finalists in the competition, giving me the opportunity to travel to Manchester and present the app to the club.

You can find the code and additional information in the [GitHub repository]({{ page. repo }}).
