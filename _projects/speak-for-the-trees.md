As a member of [Code4Community](/projects/code4community), a student organization at Northeastern University, I led a team of ten students in developing a [platform]({{ page.link }}) to support Speak for the Trees in their mission. The project involved building a front-end using React and TypeScript, enabling the organization to reserve blocks, map trees, engage users, and monitor their progress. Additionally, I oversaw the development of a Java back-end to store and serve all of their data.

My responsibilities included organizing and leading meetings, creating tickets, reviewing code, and contributing to the development process. While my primary focus was on designing and implementing the back-end architecture, I also contributed to key front-end features, such as the interactive map.
Throughout the project, I maintained regular communication with Speak for the Trees, discussing our progress, gathering feedback on desired features for upcoming releases, and addressing any questions they had. This collaboration ensured that the platform effectively met their needs and supported their mission.
